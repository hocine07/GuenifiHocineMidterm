Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. Java life cycle is the process of developing, testing, and releasing java applications. the first step of this life cycle is devloping,
where developers write java codes using different IDEs, after writing the codes,these codes needs to be compiled
into the machine code which will be executed by the JVM. Now after the developers are done with the application and before
deploying it, it has to be tested to ensure that all the functionalities are working fine and there are no errors or bugs so can
the application  be deployed to users. And lastly it is important to continue to maintain and update it.

what is class?
A.Class is a blueprint, any code thats written should be under a class otherwise its not gonna be executed.

What is object?
A.An object is an instance of class.we use it in order to call a method and to access the variables.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. the entry point of an application is the main method.

A.

what is Access Specifier?
A. In Java, an access specifier is a keyword that determines the visibility and accessibility
of a class, and attributes.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects", which can contain
data and code that manipulates that data, the OOP concept has 3 features:
1-Inheretence:(is all about classes) is a class inheriting some attributes of another class.
2-encapsulation in java means hiding data or variables by using the access modifier private.
3-polymorphism is a method overriding and overloading.

A. Mtehod Overloading is a type of polymorphism, it occurs  when 2 methods have the same name but different numbers of parameters.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.An exception in java is an event that happens when we execute a code that messes up the whole process, it can only be handled
by applying the try-catch block.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A- Static uses only static variables and does not access anything that is not static.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. Final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes and attributes in general which makes them unchangeable.
-final variables means that you cannot reassign or give another value to that variable.
- Final method means that method cannot be overridden by subclasses.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.Final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes and attributes in general which makes them unchangeable.
- FinallyThe finally block is used in a try-catch-finally construct to specify
 code that should be executed whether or not an exception is thrown.
- Finalize The finalize method is a method that is called by the Java garbage collector before an object is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
A. A constructor is Constructor is a block of codes similar to a method used implicitly during the creation of an object.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.Yes, it is possible to have multiple constructors in a class in Java.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is it called during object creation?
A.In this case Java will automatically provide a default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.In Java, the "this" keyword is a reference to the current object.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.In Java, the "super" keyword is used to refer to the immediate superclass of the current object.
- We can us it in order to access variables, constructors and methods of the superclass.

What is JVM stand for ?
A.JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.

Is JVM platform independent?

What is heap?
A. It is a data structure that is used to manage memory at runtime.

How java manage it's memory?
A.Java manages memory automatically through a process called garbage collection.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A. String is immutable, meaning that it cannot be changed once its created, but StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable,
StringBuffer is thread-safe which means that it can be used in a multi-threaded environment and
